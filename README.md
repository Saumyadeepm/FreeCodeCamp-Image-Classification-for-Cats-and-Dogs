# FreeCodeCamp-Image-Classification-for-Cats-and-Dogs

1. **Problem Statement:**
  - *Image Classification for Cats and Dogs*

1. **Overview**
  - *In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can classify images as either containing a cat or a dog. This task is a classic example of binary image classification, where the model must learn to distinguish between two classes: cats and dogs.*

1. **Dataset**
  - *We have access to a dataset consisting of images of cats and dogs. The dataset is labeled, meaning each image is assigned a class label indicating whether it contains a cat or a dog.*

1. **Objective**
  - *The objective of this project is to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the provided dataset to accurately classify images of cats and dogs. The model should be capable of generalizing well to unseen images and achieve a high level of accuracy in distinguishing between the two classes.*

1. **Approach**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** *We will preprocess the image data, including resizing images to a standard size, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the training data to improve model generalization.*
  - **Model Development:** *We will design a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks. The model will consist of multiple convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.*
  - **Model Training:** *We will train the CNN model using the preprocessed training data. The training process involves optimizing the model parameters to minimize a predefined loss function.*
  - **Model Evaluation:** *We will evaluate the trained model's performance using a separate set of validation data. We will assess metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to measure the model's effectiveness in classifying images.*
  - **Model Testing:** *Finally, we will assess the model's performance on a separate test dataset to evaluate its ability to generalize to unseen data. We will calculate the model's accuracy and compare it against predefined performance thresholds.*
